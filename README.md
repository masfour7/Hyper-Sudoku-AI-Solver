# Hyper-Sudoku-AI-Solver

- The purpose of this project is to Build an AI system that solves the Hyper Sudoku in a few seconds.
- Programming language: Python, IDE: PyCharm
- Applied the Forward Checking algorithm to reduce the domain of neighbors to cells which already had numbers
in them

Description of the formulation:
- Variables: The variables will be each cell on the grid.
- Domain: The domain will be any digit from 1 to 9
- Constraints: The constraints are:
1. Same digit can't appear twice (or more) in the same row.
2. Same digit can't appear twice (or more) in the same column.
3. Same digit can't appear twice (or more) in the same cell.
4. Same digit can't appear twice (or more) in the same hyper cell.
